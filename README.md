Work in progress. I'm composing this little project with AI to lern deeply about ML and trading strategy development Basically the plan is: EMA crossover is detected. This signals a possible buy or sell. For confirmation, I want to run the ML models and compare the results. End result: EMA crossover + 3/5 ML models confirm BUY/SELL.
