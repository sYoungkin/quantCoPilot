# quantCoPilot

Work in progress. I'm composing this little project with AI to 1) lern deeply about ML and trading strategy development, and 2) hopefully be profitable when trading. See notes for a quick overview of the structure. Basically the plan is: EMA crossover is detected. This signals a possible buy or sell. For confirmation, I want to run the ML models and compare the results. End result: EMA crossover + 3/5 ML models confirm BUY/SELL.
