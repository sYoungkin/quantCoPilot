Work in progress. I'm composing this project with the help of AI to lern more about machine learning and trading strategy development. Basically the plan is to first detect an EMA crossover. This signals a possible long or short position. For confirmation, I want to run the ML models and compare their predictive results of whether a trend is beginning. End result: EMA crossover + 3/5 ML models confirm BUY/SELL position. Features include RSI, MACD and Bollinger bands. Unfortunately, no volume data is provided by Yahoo's API, only price data.
