Work in progress. I'm composing this project with the help AI to lern about machine learning and trading strategy development. Basically the plan is fto irst detect an EMA crossover. This signals a possible long or short position. For confirmation, I want to run the ML models and compare their predictive results of whther a trend is beginning. End result: EMA crossover + 3/5 ML models confirm BUY/SELL position.
