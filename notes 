python data/fetch_data.py --pair EUR/USD --timeframe 1min --limit 1000
python main.py --pair EUR/USD --timeframe 1min

Plan:
-> build fetch_data.py
-> build models one by one and test
-> build main.py with imports and alert logic
-> need logging
-> Backtest: we need to run the alert logic on historical data check winrate, PnL
->
-> Live: fetch every minute, main on schedul, alert to telegram on BUY/SELL signal

main.py will do:
-> import data, indicator (ema_crossover), copilot_engine (it executes the ML models ), notify
-> logic:
-> import data into df
-> call ema_crossover and calculate signal
-> send data into copilot engine
-> log and alert
backtest engine does something similar
-> logic
-> import data, indicator (ema_crossover), copilot_engine (it executes the ML models )
-> run trades and calculate metrics
-> log

### ✅ 1. **XGBoost / LightGBM**

- 🔥 Fast, powerful tree-based models
- Works great on engineered features
- Can model **nonlinear interactions** (e.g. RSI + volume spike = breakout)
- Handles noise better than raw indicators

✅ **Why it’s great for scalping**:

- Picks up tiny edge patterns hidden in short-term candles
- Handles overlapping signals (price + volatility + volume)

---

### ✅ 2. **Logistic Regression**

- Old school, but interpretable
- Use it to model binary outcomes: “Is next candle bullish?”

✅ **Use for**:

- Quick signals
- Confidence scoring
- Live probability filtering

---

### ✅ 3. **Random Forest**

- Similar to XGBoost but more interpretable
- Feature importance built in
- Good for exploring what really matters in your feature set

---

### ✅ 4. **KNN (k-nearest neighbors)**

- Can be surprisingly effective on candle patterns
- Finds similar past price behaviors and assumes repeatability

✅ **Use for**:

- Classifying current setup based on similar past candles
- Quick backtestable pattern matching

---

### ✅ 5. **LSTM (if you go deeper)**

- Recurrent Neural Net — remembers past candles
- Great for learning sequence behavior in price + volume
- Needs more tuning, more data, more time

✅ **Use for**:

- Predicting short-term trend continuation
- Anticipating momentum shifts
